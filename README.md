## LGP v0.1 - A Python 3 library for FF7's LGP files

This is currently a work-in-progress, and is not finished.
This can extract any archive except for `magic.lgp`, which is being worked on.
You can drag-and-drop an archive file to extract it directly in the current
directory; `char.lgp` will become `char`, `battle.lgp` will be `battle`, etc.
